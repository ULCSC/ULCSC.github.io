### Rules

#### Academic Integrity

- While helping each other learn is one of the main
  goals of our club, we still must comply with the
  University of Lethbridge's policy on academic
  dishonesty. This means sharing answers to tests
  or individual assigments is strictly prohibited.

#### Other Rules

- Same rules apply as in our discord:

- If we need more, we can hold a referendum on it.
