# OSX Set Up

The following is a guide on getting your Mac set up for coding.
There are a couple of ways to code on OSX, here we will show you one of the ways
that works with the software that the school uses.

> [!Warning]
> The University of Lethbridge is not responsible for the set-up of your
> machine, this is a guide set up by the ULSCU.

## Configuring Shell

Zsh or Z shell is the preffered shell to use on MacOS, of course, you can use bash
however that is not what we'll be covering in this tutorial.

### Check if Zsh is installed by running

```sh
which zsh
```

If zsh is installed (which it should be by default) this command will return the
path to zsh.

### Check if Zsh is being used by running

```sh
echo ${SHELL}
```

#### Enable Zsh

Zsh should be enabled by default, however if it is not, enable it by running:

```sh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

> [!Note]
> if the command above didn't work, or you got a system message saying you need to
> install dev tools, install them. Install with:
>
> `xcode-select --install`
>
>
> That may take a bit of time, once it is done, install .
>

Alternatively, you can open up your terminals prefferences by running `cmd ,`. and
changing the radio button labeled "shells open with" from default to command and
entering '/bin/zsh'.

**For the switch to take effect, you may have to quit and shut down terminal.**

> [!Important]  
> It is very important to note, that the next part is non essential
> If you have dev tools installed, you should already be able to
> compile projects with clang. For most of your degree, that is all
> you will need. The one thing to note, is when you begin to use
> makefiles, you'll need to switch the build instruction if you are using
> clang.

## Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager that simplifies downloading and installing
software on MacOS.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
```

> [!Note]
> if the command above didn't work, it could mean you need to install devtools first.
> install with:
>
> `xcode-select --install`
>
>
> That may take a bit of time, once it is done, install Homebrew.
>

## 2. Enter Zshrc

Now go to your home directory, you can reach it by typing `cd`. Then type
`ls -a` this should show you all of the files and directories in your home directory
(even the hidden ones). We are looking for the .zshrc file.

It should be there by default, however if its not there run the following:

```sh
touch ~/.zshrc
```

You can open your zshrc using any editor. You can use any editor, for this you may
have the easiest time using vim, or nano. This way you can open up the .zshrc in
terminal.

> [!Warning]
> It is **highly recommended** that you watch a tutorial on using vim / nano before
> using them, as writing to, saving and quiting in the editor is a little finicky.
>
> You can also learn vim by typing `vimtutor` in the command line.

### Format Zshrc

The zshrc allows you to configure what your shell can do. In the next step we will
create an alias that will allow you to use the g++ compiler, but there are a couple
of things we must do before reaching that step.

First of all, type `brew doctor` into the terminal, if you don't get an error, skip
this step entirely.

#### Add Homebrew to path

The only formatting that you might have to do right now is adding Homebrew to your
path. This will allow you to access what you have installed with Homebrew in your
terminal.

First of all, type `cat .zprofile` in your terminal, if you have something similar
to:

##### Apple Silicon

```sh
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

or

##### Intell

```sh
eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

If you don't, don't worry:

##### Apple Silicon

For Apple Silicon add the following to your .zshrc

```sh
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
```

##### Intell Based

For Intell Based macs, add the following to your .zshrc

```sh
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

where usr is the name of the user, check the name of your macs user, by running `pwd`
while in your home directory:

Whis will show `/Users/exampleuser`, exampleuser is the usr.

## Install gcc / g++

Using Homebrew we can now install gcc and g++.

```sh
brew install gcc
```

This is the compiler type that the school uses, and although clang (macs default)
will work for the most part, for more modern features of C++ clang tends to lag
behind.

### Add g++ to zshrc

Now to compile files with g++, you need to create a terminal alias for g++, there
are a couple of ways to do this, however the easiest is to create an alias in you
zshrc.

**Write all aliases after Exports**

#### Apple Silicon

```sh
alias cxx="/opt/homebrew/opt/gcc/bin/g++-14"
```

#### Intell

```sh
alias cxx="/usr/local/opt/gcc/bin/g++-14"
```

Now to run c++ files in your terminal you can run

```sh
g++ -o exe test.cpp  # To Compile
./exe # To  Run
rm exe # To  Remove
```

## Issues

If you are a pro at using your Mac and see any potential issues with this
tutorial please let one of the executives know.
