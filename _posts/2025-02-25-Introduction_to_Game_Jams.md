## What is a Game Jam

A **Game Jam** is a competitive programming event where participants work
individually or in teams (often 3-5 people) to create a game. Typically, the
Jam has a theme, and sometimes organizers will also introduce a **special object**
that must be included in the game, in addition to the theme. Special objects can
push participants to think creatively, and add variety to submissions.
Game Jams can last from a few hours to days, weeks, months, and some go on for
years. All development, including design, prototyping, testing, and deployment,
happens within this timeframe.

## Why participate in Game Jams

**Game Jams** are a fantastic way to level up your skills. Even if you're
already confident in your abilities, there are tons of other benefits to
joining one. For starters, often there are **prizes** for the winners, which can
range based on who is hosting the the event, and their sponsors. Participating
in a game jam can also significantly **boost your resume**. It can demonstrate
your ability to work within time constraints, work on a team, and think creatively.
Game jams are also a great way to network with other developers, artists, and
musicians, helping you **build professional relationships**. Whether you're working
solo or as part of a team, the experience can be incredibly rewarding and will
push you to grow both as a developer.
