## What is a Hackathon?

A **Hackathon** is a type of competitive programming event wherein people work
individually or in a team (often 3-5 people) to solve a problem. Often
times the problem has a theme, or main idea, a few examples of this could
be everyone need's to use Python, or they're submission needs to have a
specific parameter like AI. Hackathons can last from a few hours to a few
days to even a couple months. Your design, prototyping, testing and
deployment can only happen within the timeframe.

## Why Participate in Hackathons?

**Hackathons** and programming competitions are a great way to improve your
skills. Even if you feel confident in your abilities, there are plenty of
other reasons to join one. First of all, many hackathons offer **prizes**
for the winners, which vary depending on the event's sponsors. Another
reason is that participating in a hackathon can **strengthen your resume**,
competing in a hackathon shows you're capable of working under pressure,
collaborating with other people, and creative thinking, all of which are
very important in any job, especially those in Computer Science. Hackathons
are also a great way to **network with other developers** and expand your
professional connections. Whether you're competing solo or as part of a team,
the experience can be very rewarding, and will help you grow as a developer.
