These will be silent demonstrations, and not gifs. If I use gifs they'll
take too long. Also I think it'll probably be nice to pause the videos.

## cp (copy)

{%
  include embed/video.html
  src='../assets/intermediate_commands/cp-ulcsc.mp4'
  title='Copy Demo'
  autoplay=true
  loop=true
  muted=true
%}

## mv (move)

{%
  include embed/video.html
  src='../assets/intermediate_commands/mv-ulcsc.mp4'
  title='Move video'
  autoplay=true
  loop=true
  muted=true
%}

## less

{%
  include embed/video.html
  src='../assets/intermediate_commands/less-ulcsc.mp4'
  title='Less Video'
  autoplay=true
  loop=true
  muted=true
%}

## Other Info

I could include lines of documentation, but the best way to
learn how to use these commands is to practice.

## Issues

If you see any issues or something wrong inside of this guide do not
hesitate to message an executive so we can fix it.
